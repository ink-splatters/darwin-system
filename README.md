## Darwin system

`nix-darwin` + `home-manager` based, declarative macOS configuration. 

That's not a template [on the moment]. Inspire and build your own!

## A note about Provisioning profiles

Those are to be replaced by using corresponding _nix-darwin_ / _home-manager_ features.

**WARNING**: Profiles can be evil. Installing password restrictions - related profiles (especially system-wide) is strongly discouraged unless you know what you are doing. There is a danger of lockout which, in catastrophical corner case, is permanent and implies irrecoverable data loss.
