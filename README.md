## Darwin system

`nix-darwin` + `home-manager` based, declarative `macOS` configuration. Early development. Poduction use is discouraged. 

### Platforms

`Apple Silicon` is first-class citizen. Intel would be likely broken out of the box, and there are no immediate plans to fix it. PRs are welcome, however.

### Status

TODO (awaiting start of implementation)
